# Jian Yang tslint formatter

*tslint formatter* with quotes by Jian Yang ðŸ‘“ as seen on _HBO Silicon Valley_. Some quote has been slightly edited to suite better a code linter output message

The output matches what is produced by ESLint's stylish formatter. Just a bit more funny and less useful and informative.

## Usage

Download
[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](./dist/jianyangFormatter.js)
and run tslint from your project folder

```
tslint -p tsconfig.json --formatters-dir /[full path where you downloaded  jianyangFormatter.js ] --format jianyang
```

*Have Fun!*
